# Mintbase Grant Proposal

- **Project Name:** Gorilla Shops
- **Team Name:** Gorilla Funds UG
- **Payment Address:** gorillashops.near
- **[Level](../README.md#level_slider-levels):** 3

## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

Gorilla Shops builds Store-Fronts with connected CMS upon the Mintbase Smart Contracts. These Store Fronts can be easily set up with the Gorilla Shops Page Builder. The Store-Fronts can be easily adjusted to the needs of a Store-Owner of a Mintbase Store and we are going to implement additional functionalities like
Token Gated Content. The Store-Fronts enhance Mintbase' functionality and hereby delivers value to the Mintbase and NEAR ecosystem. Gorilla Shops wants to become the Shopify for NFT-Shops build on top of Mintbase.

### Project Details

We already developed a working product on top of Mintbase and want to enhance the functionalities drastically. You can find our working product on Mainnet under "https://gorillashops.io" and on Testnet under "https://testnet.gorillashops.io".

Additional features:

We are going to add:

- additional UI-Components that can be easily dropped in from within the CMS
- add all minting functionalities to the CMS
- add the possibility to easily restrict the content to holders of a token that can be specified from within the CMS.
- add the Auction-Feature
- add presets that enhance the customizability of the Shop Pages that are adjusted to the needs of special shops - like a music store preset, a ticket store preset, a game item preset or a preset for luxury goods like wine. But with the token gated content feauture there are also presets for journalists and authors thinkable that allow content for members, or influencer web pages with additional information for token holder. The possibilities are endless.

See the following Drafts for a Music, a Ticket, a Gaming or a Wine Store preset.

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Mintbase landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?

Gorilla Shops enhance the functionality of Mintbase and strive to become a hub for Store-Front Development.
On the one hand we want to open up the development of these store fronts but want to ensure that the designs work out of the box. On the other hand the Store Fronts shall work without coding knowledge. So that artits,
musicians but also journalists can leverage Mintbase without any hassle.

- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?

In the first run we target the users of Mintbase Stores. We want them to be able to set up Store Fronts by click that are a helpful tool to build their business model around their products. In the second run we target developers and designers. We want them to be able to easily add themes and components for the Store-Fronts that can be added from within the Page Builder. Our goal is to create a system that helps designers and developers to create a additional source of income by providing Themes and components to our system.

- What need(s) does your project meet?

We help Store owners to push their brand and to create an own business around their Mintbase Shop.

- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Mintbase / NEAR ecosystem?

Harmonic Guild builds Store Fronts as well. Mintickt builds ticket systems on Mintbase, we will also enable
Ticket Store Fronts.

- If so, how is your project different?

Both do not automate the Store-Creation right now and have no connected CMS.

- If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?

## Clarifications

We will release the Front End Code that is used by the builder as well as the Code for the Sanity-CMS so that a developer can set this up and build upon this from this Repostitory without using the Builder. We will provide a clear documentation about how this works. The Code for the Builder is not part of this Grant Proposal. We will keep the Builder for now closed source.

## Future Plans

We will continue working on Gorilla Shops as we want to become the Shopify for NFT-Shops. Besides this Proposal we are working on the Batch Minter AUTOMAT and the Figma-Plugin UNIKAT.

## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign:

**How did you hear about the Grants Program?** From the Mintbase-Team

We applied for a grant for the initial development of the first Proof of Concept of the store fronts. The results can be found here.
